# Text-Analysis-Tool
a tool that will read as an input a text file and then perform several word analytics tasks


<h2>Operations: </h2>


<p>(1) An operation to determine the total number of words in a text file (i.e., the length of 
the file).</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>(2) An operation to determine the total number of unique words in a text file.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>(3) An operation to determine the total number of occurrences of a particular word.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>(4) An operation to determine the total number of words with a particular length.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>5) An operation to display the unique words and their occurrences sorted by the total
occurrences of each word (from the most frequent to the least).</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>(6) An operation to display the locations of the occurrences of a word starting from the 
top of the text file (i.e., as a list of line and word positions). Note that every new-line 
character ‘\n’ indicates the end of a line.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>(7) An operation to examine if two words are occurring adjacent to each other in the file 
(at least one occurrence of both words is needed to satisfy this operation).</p>
<p></p>
<br>

<h2>Remarks:</h2>

<h3>
• lines end with "\n"
<p></p>
• words are separated by at least one space. 
<p></p>
• Single letter words (e.g., a, I) are counted as words. 
<p></p>
• Punctuation (e.g., commas, periods, etc.) is to be ignored. 
<p></p>
• Hyphenated words (e.g., decision-makers) or apostrophized words (e.g., customer’s) 
are to be read as single words.
